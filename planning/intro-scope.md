Personal budgeting remains a critical challenge for many individuals. In Malaysia, digital payments and fintech adoption have risen significantly, yet financial literacy is limited (only ~36% of adults are financially knowledgeable (Sabri et al., 2024)). Research suggests that personal finance apps can improve financial behaviours by providing visibility and control. This project presents a budget tracker application named Kopi Money. It is developed in React Native (TypeScript) and Expo, the module allows users to select an expense category, record expenses locally, and set a monthly budget. Each successful expense entry triggers a push notification to confirm logging, and the system automatically checks the monthly total against the user-set budget. If spending exceeds the budget, a push notification alert is sent. A dashboard screen visualizes spending by category using charts, helping users understand their expenditure patterns (Andrew, 2023). The implementation involved setting up an Expo project, defining TypeScript data models, and integrating AsyncStorage for local persistence and Expo Notifications for alerts. Testing included unit tests for data processing and a manual test matrix for functional flows. Preliminary evaluation showed that notifications were delivered reliably and users found the alerts helpful for staying within budget. This module demonstrates how timely notifications and data visualization can promote financial discipline. Future work may extend this module with cloud sync and AI-driven budgeting suggestions. The Kopi Money meets its goals of aiding expense management and aligns with evidence that fintech tools encourage savings behaviors. 2. Introduction
2.1 Personal Finance Apps in Malaysia
The proliferation of smartphones has enabled many Malaysians to adopt mobile apps for personal finance. Services for payments and savings are growing; for example, digital payment adoption in Malaysia rose from 1.4% in 2011 to 16% in 2019 (Sabri et al., 2024). Despite this growth, financial literacy remains low, meaning many people struggle with budgeting and saving. Popular apps like Wally, MoneyCoach, and Finory illustrate demand for tools that help users track spending and set goals. As one finance guide notes, budgeting apps make it easier to “stay on top of your spending” by replacing manual methods with automated tracking.

2.2 Motivation for Budget Alerts
A common problem is overspending before users realize it. Many modern budgeting apps address this by sending notifications to warn when spending is close to or over limits. For instance, PocketGuard explicitly advertises alerts for fees and “budget overspending”, and warns “when you’re exceeding your budgets”. These timely alerts act as behavioural nudges, making users more aware of their consumption. Motivated by this approach, the Kopi Money app aims to send push notifications both upon adding an expense and whenever the monthly budget is exceeded. The goal is to help users react immediately to overspending.

2.3 Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate the Kopi Money app. The module includes the following features:
• Expense Categorization: Users select an expense type (e.g. Food, Travel, Shopping) via a picker control.
• Expense Entry: Users enter an expense amount and optional note, which is saved locally.
• Push Notifications: On saving an expense, the app sends a confirmation notification. If the user’s total monthly spending exceeds the preset budget, an “Over Budget” notification is automatically triggered.
• Budget Limit Setting: In settings, the user can set or update their monthly budget.
• Dashboard View: A summary screen displays spending by category (using pie charts) so users can visualize where money is going.
